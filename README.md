## Appeals process

There is no appeals process.

Our community managers have limited time and energy. It can be used to:

  1. Work towards **Forum** goals by encouraging friendships, mentorships, and collaborations aligned with Elm’s goals.
  2. Relitigate cases for posters who have demonstrated a **Pattern** of participation in **Conflict**.

These two activities compete directly for time and energy. It is possible that a mistake was made, but we have decided to focus on (1) at the expense of (2).

Some posters do not realize they are participating in **Conflict**. Here are some general notes on that:

  - _Desiring_ friendship does not imply that you are _encouraging_ friendship in the **Forum**.
  - _Desiring_ mentorship does not imply that you are _encouraging_ mentorship in the **Forum**.
  - _Desiring_ collaboration does not imply that you are _encouraging_ collaboration aligned with the Elm’s goals in the **Forum**.
